      <h1>International version of Sorteria</h1>
      <h3>Sorteria’s vision goes beyond Norway’s borders</h3>
      <p>
        The idea is that the concept should first be tested in Norway to get an overview of the
        interest and impact of the product. This is because Norway's effort is ranked as 5th in 
        the world where 40% of total waste is recycled. It is reasonable to assume that the focus 
        towards climate friendly actions will increase in the future. It is therefore important that 
        the tools that are developed make these solutions accessible to everyone.
      </p>
      <h3>Sorteria needs to be inclusive and adaptable</h3>
      <p>
          In order to best implement this solution in other countries where the technology 
          landscape is different. When sharing this solution with other countries, 
          considering the widespread usage of phones is crucial.
