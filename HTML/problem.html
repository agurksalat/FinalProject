            The problem is people are not recycling enough. It is not always clear where one should throw away the trash. This makes people frustrated and “give up” the recycle-process. Other issues include lack of recycling stations, or that they are not easily accessible. We have also heard complaints about lack of space at home, because you need so many different bins for the different kinds of trash (one for food, one for plastic, another for non-recyclable waste etc.)
          </p>
          <p>
            The target group is people who want to learn more about recycling. People who care about the planet and their own impact. The app will have special features to cater to people with disabilities so it is accessible for everyone. These functions include changing text size, language, brightness, scan function, speech function, and the possibility to change colors.

            This problem is mostly met at home when you buy a product with packaging, but you don’t know where to throw it away. We want to make it easier for people to find the information they need, to help them recycle more in their own home.
          </p>

            This is mainly a social problem where people’s recycling habits are affected by their knowledge, opportunity, and motivation. People are more aware about recycling and sustainable living and according to The Telegraph, “eight out of ten people believe recycling makes a difference..” (kilde?). However, many people do not know where to recycle or which bin to use. This has direct and indirect negative effects on their motivations and opportunities. Furthermore, some people are motivated to recycle, but are hindered from doing so because of physical or visual restraints.

            The growing climate crisis is upon us. We see time and time again the impacts of our disposable ways. We produce, and throw away. This has lasting effects on our climate, and one of the contributors to the growing climate change is willingness to recycle, and information on how to recycle.
