      <h1>The Problem</h1>
      <p>
        Research has shown that less than 50% of household waste is recycled, and most end up 
        in the residual waste bin. When people do not sort and make good, environmentally sound choices, 
        the waste processing companies can not ensure that the resources in the waste are revitalized 
        into new products. According to the survey conducted by Sorteria, more than 80% claim that they 
        care about recycling to a medium or large extent. On the other hand, when asked in our survey, 
        more than 75% answer that they often or sometimes find it difficult to know what to throw where.

        People don’t recycle as much as they should be. Recycling requires action because you need to 
        be aware of what you are throwing away, and where. When this becomes confusing, people use that 
        as an excuse, because it is much easier to avoid doing something than actually doing it.
      </p>
      <p>
        According to our survey people also find it difficult to know where the recycling stations are located.
        The problem here is the lack of information about the locations of the recycling stations.

        Together with ROAF, Romerike avfallsfordling, which is the waste processing company for a large portion of Akershus’ municipalities, 
        Sorteria works towards making it as simple as possible to be environmentally friendly through making 
        recycling easier and more accessible for everyone. ROAF and Sorteria are working together towards reaching 
        our 2030 goal at 70% recycled material.

        The attitude towards recycling needs to change, and the general public needs to have access to information 
        about where waste goes, if not, people will not care to recycle, which is shown in the studies mentioned above.

        We know that a little effort will result in great environmental benefits, and that together we can 
        achieve the goals we have set.

      <h2>Technological or social problem?</h2>
      <p>
        This is mainly a social problem where people’s recycling habits are affected by their knowledge, opportunity, and motivation. 
        People are more aware about recycling and sustainable living and according to The Telegraph,
        “eight out of ten people believe recycling makes a difference..” 
        (<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/09/25/eight-ten-people-believe-recycling-makes-difference-have-no/">The Telegraph, 2017</a>). 
        However, many people do not know where to recycle or which bin to use. 
        This has direct and indirect negative effects on their motivations and opportunities. Furthermore, 
        some people are motivated to recycle, but are hindered from doing so because of physical or visual restraints.
