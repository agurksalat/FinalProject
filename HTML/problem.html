      <h1>The Problem</h1>
      <p>
        People don’t recycle as much as they should be. Recycling requires action, 
        you need to be aware of what you are throwing away, and where,. When this becomes confusing, 
        people use that as an excuse, because it is much easier to avoid doing something than actually doing it.
      </p>
      <p>
        According to ROAF, people in Akershus county have a lot of excuses to avoid recycling. 
        People say they don’t have time, it’s too messy, and that they don’t have the energy. 
        These three excuses together account for 35% of the 1000 people interviewed. 
        22% of the interviewed say they don’t recycle because they don’t know what the material 
        is made of and consequently don’t know where to recycle it.
      </p>
      <p>
        According to our own miniature survey, we found that 53,5% of people in our circle are 
        committed to recycling at a medium degree, and 47,2% say they don’t know where to throw their trash.

        Other issues include lack of recycling stations, or that they are not easily accessible. 
        We have also heard complaints about lack of space at home, because you need so many different 
        bins for the different kinds of trash: One for food, one for plastic, and another one for non-recyclable waste.  
      </p>
      <p>
        The attitude towards recycling needs to change, and the general public needs to have access to information 
        about where waste goes, if not, people will not care to recycle, which is shown in the studies mentioned before.

      <h2>Technological or social problem?</h2>
      <p>
        This is mainly a social problem where people’s recycling habits are affected by their knowledge, opportunity, and motivation. 
        People are more aware about recycling and sustainable living and according to The Telegraph,
        “eight out of ten people believe recycling makes a difference..” 
        (<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/09/25/eight-ten-people-believe-recycling-makes-difference-have-no/">The Telegraph, 2017</a>). 
        However, many people do not know where to recycle or which bin to use. 
        This has direct and indirect negative effects on their motivations and opportunities. Furthermore, 
        some people are motivated to recycle, but are hindered from doing so because of physical or visual restraints.
