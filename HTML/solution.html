      <p>
        Sorteria is a recycling app with many features which makes it easy to find information 
        about where to recycle, what to recycle, and also why to recycle the products and packaging 
        that everyone has. Sorteria is designed to educate, inform, and cause action throughout the
        generations and hopefully spark change in attitude towards recycling.
      </p>

      <p>
        In order to make recycling more accessible, Sorteria wants to share information regarding where to recycle, how to recycle and where to find information about this. The sorteria app offers overview over where the user can go to recycle and where to recycle the item.   
      </p>
      <h3>The main features of the app to the general public are:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The ability to search for any item you want by name or barcode</li>
        <li>Scanning items to get information about where to recycle the item</li>
        <li>A map, to see where the nearest recycling stations are</li>
        <li>Informational page to gather information about recycling in your county/municipality</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Specific features made with vision impaired in mind:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The ability for a voice to read the features of the app</li>
        <li>Voice recognition to speak to the app instead of typing, so you can search by voice</li>
        <li>The scanning feature was also thought of to tailor to vision-impaired people to make 
          it easier to identify an item. The scanning feature will also feature audio feedback to 
          help vision impaired people who cannot see the recycling symbols on different products.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The app can use your location to automatically prioritize information about recycling in your area, 
        giving the user an overview of the recycling system in their area.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sorteria can be used by anyone who is interested in recycling, 
        but is specifically optimized with blind and vision impaired people in mind.
      </p>
      <p>
        The map feature will provide audio communication activated by either the users touch or voice.         
      </p>
      <p>
          The main problem people have with recycling, is that it is too difficult and not enough information. 
          Sorteria hopes to solve parts of this problem by being accessible to anyone. 
          It is a lot easier to open an app with all the answers, than browsing the internet looking for answers. 
          The specificity of the app is what people need to think of recycling as easy and necessary.
